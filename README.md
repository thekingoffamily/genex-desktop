[issues](https://github.com/genex-games/genex-desktop/issues).

### What it does

→ Use your Claude Code or ChatGPT subscription\
→ Or run local models\
→ Multi-agent game dev: mix Opus and GPT models across the main agent, workers and reviewers\
→ Make 3D assets locally with the Blender plugin\
→ Meshy, Tripo, ElevenLabs and more through the Genex tools router\
→ Export anywhere, or publish to the web\
→ Unity and Unreal plugins soon\
→ Native C++ games soon

> [!TIP]
> Have a tool your games need? [Build a plugin](#build-a-plugin) and put it in the Genex
> Marketplace for everyone.

### Contributing

You need Git and Node 24. Development runs on macOS (Apple Silicon), Windows and Linux.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/genex-games/genex-desktop.git
cd genex-desktop
nvm install && nvm use   # Node 24, from .nvmrc
npm ci
npm run studio:dev -- start --profile first-run --fixture app-basics
```

The fixture runs the app with scripted models and sample games, so it needs no account. Read
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before you open a pull request; coding agents start at
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

### Build a plugin

Plugins give Genex's agents new tools: an asset generator, an engine bridge, a service your
game talks to. The Blender and Genex tools that ship with the app are plugins too. From a Genex
checkout:

```bash
npm run plugin:new -- my-plugin --out ~/studio-plugins   # scaffold it from the example
npm run plugin:doctor -- ~/studio-plugins/my-plugin      # check it the way Genex will
```

1. **Try it**: in the app, **Plugins → Add → Load local plugin…** and pick the folder.
2. **Share it**: push it to a public GitHub repository and publish a release for each version.
   Anyone can install it from there with **Plugins → Add → Install from GitHub…**.
3. **List it**: open a pull request to
   [genex-plugins](https://github.com/genex-games/genex-plugins/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). A
   maintainer reviews it, and it appears in every Genex app's Marketplace.

The [plugin guide](docs/PLUGIN_GUIDE.md) covers tools, panels, settings and accounts.
