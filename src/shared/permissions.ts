/**
 * Permission modes and tool permission requests for a game chat: the five modes Claude Code
 * offers and the Allow / Deny questions it asks, answered in the chat instead of a terminal. Every
 * engine's chat session follows the chat's mode as far as it can (`permissionModesFor`).
 *
 * Whoever answers the person in a game chat asks: the chat's own session, and a build's lead or the
 * run's coordinator on Claude Code while it answers a message the person sent. Unattended work (builders,
 * workers, playtesters, scouts, judges, candidates) never waits on a person: it keeps the sandboxed
 * contract of the engine that runs it. The host decides which is which from what it recorded
 * itself, and keeps the mode and every saved grant; the harness can neither read nor set them.
