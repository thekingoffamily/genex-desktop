/**
 * Sandboxed process spawn (no Docker; containment via Anthropic's
 * sandbox-runtime, Seatbelt on macOS).
 *
 * **Every agent-originated process goes through here.** The harness itself is plain Node and can
 * import `fs` and `child_process`; containment holds because it is started through
 * `spawnLongLived` under the Seatbelt profile, and every child it or an agent starts inherits
 * that profile. That keeps the property true even after the agent has rewritten all of its own
 * tools. Host RPC arguments are therefore not pre-contained: a path-taking method validates its
 * own paths.
 *
 * Verified against @anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime 0.0.73:
 *  - `SandboxManager.initialize(config)` is a **singleton**; per-run policy goes through the
 *    `customConfig` argument of `wrapWithSandboxArgv`.
 *  - `network.deniedDomains` and `filesystem.denyWrite` are **required** by the config schema
 *    (not optional as one might assume) — always fill them.
 *  - `wrapWithSandboxArgv()` returns `{ argv, env }`, which we spawn without a shell.
 *
 * On Windows the backend is srt-win under Git Bash, with session-wide grants and the environment
 * in an env file; `windows-sandbox.ts` holds those rules and the one grant session.
