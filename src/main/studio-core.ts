/**
 * Studio core — the substrate assembled.
 *
 * Everything the agent can reach goes through the method table built in {@link StudioCore.api}.
 * That table *is* the containment boundary: the harness has no filesystem authority beyond its
 * sandbox, no process spawning of its own, and no way to write the event log except through an
 * append that we head-check. The table's handlers live in `./harness-rpc/`, one module per
 * namespace; the work behind them lives in the services under `./core/` (previews, delegation,
 * recovery, self-improvement, plugin tools, conversation, assets, game threads), which the core
 * composes and hands its shared state through {@link CoreInternals}. This file keeps the
 * lifecycle (init, start, stop), the event log's front door, settings and the public surface.
 *
 * Deliberately free of Electron imports so the whole core can be exercised under plain node; the
 * preview is injected through {@link PreviewPort}.
